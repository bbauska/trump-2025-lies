          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Donald Trump has made tens of thousands of lies. These have cost human lives.</p>
          <p>Fact-checkers at The Washington Post documented 30,573 false or misleading 
            claims during his first presidential term (2016-2020), an average of 21 per 
            day. The Toronto Star tallied 5,276 false claims from January 2017 to June, 
            2019 (2 1/2 years)</p>
          <p>On January 20, 2025 Trump became president a 2nd time. God save America. 
            Grift? Yes. It started immediately. Over 3.5 billion tallied so far, between 
            Jan 20, 2025 and July 1, 2025.</p>

          Lies in his<br>
          first month<br>
          in office</h2>
        <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">President Donald Trump moved at a blistering pace in his first 
		    month back in the White House. He lied fast and furious, too.</p>
          <p>In speeches, interviews, exchanges with reporters and posts on social media, the 
            president filled his public statements not only with exaggerations but outright 
            fabrications. As he did during his first presidency, Trump made false claims with a 
            frequency and variety unmatched by any other elected official in Washington.</p>
          <p>Here is our list of Trump’s 13 biggest lies since he was inaugurated on January 20. 
            It was hard to choose.</p>
          <p>The tale of the $50 million – no, make it $100 million – in condoms for Hamas: When 
            press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced at her first official White House briefing 
            that Trump had thwarted a plan to spend $50 million “to fund condoms in Gaza,” it was 
            immediately clear the claim was highly dubious; the Trump administration had no 
            evidence to substantiate it. But Trump not only repeated the $50 million figure the 
            next day, he added an incendiary claim that the condoms were “for Hamas.” Then, days 
            after it had become obvious the $50 million figure was pure fiction, he inflated it to 
            “$100 million.”</p>
          <p>This was another example of Trumpflation – the president’s years-old habit of making 
            his inaccurate stories more and more inaccurate over time.</p>
          <p>Blaming Ukraine for starting the war on Ukraine: Russia started the war in Ukraine when 
            it invaded Ukraine in 2022. That is an obvious fact. But on Tuesday, when Trump dismissed 
            Ukrainians’ complaints about their exclusion from US-Russia negotiations about ending 
            the war, he falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war – saying, “You should’ve never 
            started it. You could’ve made a deal.” Laughable Kremlin-style propaganda, this time 
            from the president of the United States.</p>
          <p>The (non-)uniqueness of birthright citizenship: Trump offered what might have sounded 
            like a reasonable rationale for his attempt to get rid of birthright citizenship. The 
            United States, he said, is the only country that has birthright citizenship.</p>
          <p>Except that is not true, as CNN and other outlets pointed out when Trump made the same 
            claim as president in 2018 and on various other occasions. Dozens of countries, 
            including Canada and Mexico, also grant automatic citizenship to people born on their 
            soil.</p>
          <p>More up-is-down reversing of the reality of January 6: For years now, Trump has presented 
            a version of the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021, that bears little resemblance to what 
            actually happened. When he was asked in early February why he granted pardons to people 
            who assaulted first responders, he said the people he pardoned were actually “assaulted 
            by our government” and that “they didn’t assault.” This “they didn’t assault” claim was 
            a brazen denial of the obvious truth, clear in video after video and trial after trial. 
            The Justice Department has said more than 140 officers were assaulted on January 6, and 
            that more than 170 people pleaded guilty to such assaults.</p>
          <p>A gusher of deceit about California water policy: Amid disaster, more dishonesty. First, 
            Trump linked the Los Angeles wildfires to California’s decision to use some of its water 
            to protect a fish species in the northern part of the state – even though the two things 
            have nothing to do with each other, as befuddled experts explained to anyone who would 
            listen.</p>
          <p>Then, after ordering the sudden release of billions of gallons of water from Central 
            Valley reservoirs for no apparent good reason, Trump declared that some of this water 
			was heading to Los Angeles – even though it wasn’t heading to Los Angeles and couldn’t 
			go to Los Angeles.</p>
          <p>The election lie he refused to let die: What can you even say about this one at this 
		    point? Trump’s win in the free and fair 2024 election did not convince him to abandon 
			his endless lying about his defeat in the free and fair 2020 election. More than four 
			years after his loss to Joe Biden, he repeated his “rigged” nonsense during at least 
			three events on his 2025 inauguration day alone, then a bunch of times after that.</p>
          <p>That fable about Olympic boxers, again: Trump, once a prominent promoter of lies about 
		    President Barack Obama’s birthplace, continued to demonstrate no hesitation lying about 
            not only policy issues but also individual people. This time, to promote his push to 
		    try to get transgender athletes banned from the Olympics, he told his familiar story 
		    about how two gold medalists in women’s boxing at the Games in Paris last year were 
		    men who “transitioned.”</p>
		  <p>Wrong. As the International Olympic Committee repeatedly noted during the Olympics, 
		    when Trump and others made such claims, neither champion had transitioned; both were 
		    born as female and have always competed in women’s events. Even the discredited boxing 
		    authority that controversially disqualified the women from a 2023 competition, vaguely 
		    claiming a test had found they had unfair competitive advantages, did not allege they 
		    had transitioned.</p>
		  <p>The president’s fictionalized northern neighbor: Before taking office, Trump casually 
		    asserted that the Canadian people “like” his idea of Canada becoming the 51st US state. 
		    That was the opposite of the truth; the idea is hugely unpopular with the Canadian 
		    public. Then, after his inauguration, Trump continued to make stuff up about Canada – 
		    at one point posting on social media and then saying out loud that Canada prohibits US 
		    banks from doing business there. He added, “Can you believe that?” No doubt some 
		    Americans believe it, but it’s false.</p>
		  <p>Blasting Biden for a program launched under Trump: After the deadly January collision 
		    between a military helicopter and a passenger jet, Trump blamed Biden administration 
		    diversity initiatives at the Federal Aviation Administration without providing any 
		    evidence any FAA diversity policy had anything to do with the crash. He added in a 
		    fictional story about a frantic last-minute Biden push to hire people with significant 
		    disabilities as air traffic controllers, failing to explain that this FAA pilot program 
		    was actually a years-old initiative launched during his own administration in 2019.</p>
		  <p>Relentless deception about who pays tariffs: When Trump talked about the tariffs he 
		    imposed on Chinese imports in his first presidency, he spoke of how much money “from 
		    China” these tariffs generated for the US Treasury. When he talked about the additional 
		    tariffs he plans to impose on various other countries during his current presidency, he 
		    spoke of a need to “charge them.” At no point did he acknowledge that US importers, not 
		    foreign countries, are the ones who pay the actual tariff charges – or that study after 
		    study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan trade commission, found 
		    that Americans ended up bearing almost the entire cost of his first-term tariffs on 
		    Chinese products.</p>
		  <p>A wild exaggeration of the increase in autism rates: Trump keeps flirting with, though 
		    not explicitly endorsing, the thoroughly debunked conspiracy theory that childhood 
		    vaccines cause autism – and in a social media post in early February, he inflated the 
		    extent of the increase in the known prevalence of autism over the last two decades. 
		    “20 years ago, Autism in children was 1 in 10,000. NOW IT’S 1 in 34,” Trump wrote. 
		    “WOW! Something’s really wrong.” Aside from the fact that experts say the increase in 
		    autism diagnoses (to 1 in 36 children by age 8 in 2020) likely has to do with greater 
		    awareness of the symptoms and improved screening practices, public statistics from the 
		    US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the known prevalence in 2004 
		    was 1 in 125 children, not “1 in 10,000.” That’s a pretty big difference.</p>
          <p>China’s (non-)operation of the Panama Canal: Much of Trump’s lying is ad-libbed. Some of 
		    it, however, is planned in advance. Some of it, however, is written into his prepared 
		    speeches. He said in his inaugural address in January: “Above all, China is operating 
		    the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re 
		    taking it back.”</p>
		  <p>This would have been a good line if China was actually operating the Panama Canal. It 
		    isn’t; Panama is, though Trump could have raised legitimate questions about China’s 
		    influence in the area.</p>
		  <p>Trump’s invented dominance with “the youth vote”: Trump said some accurate things 
		    while touting his victory in the 2024 election, such as the fact that he swept all 
		    seven swing states. But in keeping with his longstanding practice of exaggerating 
		    even legitimate accomplishments, he also kept sprinkling in a claim that wasn’t 
		    even close to correct – an assertion that he won the youth vote “by 36 points.” 
		    In fact, exit polls show he lost the youth vote to then-Vice President Kamala 
		    Harris. Even if these polls were off, there’s no basis for the claim that he won the 
		    youth vote by 36.</p>

		  <p class="tallFirstLetter">President Donald Trump filled his first 100 days back in office 
		    with the same relentless lying and inaccuracy that was a hallmark of his first presidency 
			and his 2016 and 2024 presidential campaigns.</p>
		  <p>Some of Trump’s 2025 false claims were about consequential policy matters, others about 
		    trivial personal fixations. Some were sophisticated distortions about obscure subjects, 
		    others obvious fictions about issues average Americans experience in their daily lives. 
		    Many were ad-libbed or posted on social media, but many were scripted into prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>Aside from the staggering frequency and the trademark brazenness, what stood out was how 
		    repetitive Trump’s lying was. Though he regularly sprinkled in some fresh deception, he

		    that many of these claims had been publicly debunked for months or even years.</p>
